            <h2 class="section-title">Sai Baba's Core Teachings</h2>
            <p>Sai Baba's teachings are universal, emphasizing spiritual truths that transcend religious boundaries. Though He rarely gave formal discourses, His wisdom was conveyed through everyday interactions, parables, and His own exemplary life.</p>

            <div class="teaching-card">
                <h3 class="teaching-title">Sabka Malik Ek (One God Governs All)</h3>
                <p>The central pillar of Sai Baba's teaching was the oneness of God. He emphasized that all religions worship the same Divine Reality through different forms and practices. He demonstrated this by participating in both Hindu and Muslim rituals, maintaining a sacred fire (dhuni) while also regularly uttering "Allah Malik" (God is Master).</p>
                <div class="quote-box">
                    "I look at all with an equal eye. To Me a Hindu, a Muslim, a Parsi, a Christian, they are all the same. God has created all, He lives in all."

                <p>Sai Baba frequently emphasized these twin virtues as the foundation of spiritual life. Faith (Shraddha) in the divine and patience (Saburi) to wait for divine timing were His constant teachings to devotees who sought immediate results or miraculous solutions.</p>
                <div class="quote-box">
